## Part I
### Write the code necessary to do the following:

### i. Create an empty array called arr.
### Ans: See index5.html

### ii.  Add your first name to the arr variable
### Ans: See index5.html

### iii.  Add your last name to the end of the arr variable
### Ans: See index5.html

### iv.  Add your favorite color to the beginning of the arr variable
### Ans: See index5.html

### Your variable arr should look like this (using Elie for a first name, Schoppik for a last name and purple for a favorite color) ["purple", "Elie", "Schoppik"]. Keep going!
### Ans: See index5.html

### i. Remove the favorite color from the arr variable (remember this is the first value in the array - what method can you use to remove the first value in an array?)
### Ans: See index5.html

### ii. Create another array called arr2.
### Ans: See index5.html

### iii. Add your favorite number to arr2
### Ans: See index5.html

### iv. Add the string "JavaScript" to the end of the arr2 variable
### Ans: See index5.html

### Your variable arr2 should look like this (using 42 as a favorite number) [42, "JavaScript"].
### Ans: See index5.html

### i. See if the value 42 exists in the arr2 array. Do this using the indexOf method. What does indexOf return to you if the value passed to it can not be found in the array?
### Ans: See index5.html ---> No it is not. returns -1

### ii. Create a new variable called combinedArr which is the result of your arr and arr2 variables combined into one array.
### Ans: See index5.html

### Your combinedArr variable should look like this (using our previous values) ["Elie", "Schoppik", 42, "JavaScript"]
### Ans: See index5.html

## Part II
### Complete the following, starting from the following array: let arr = ["JavaScript", "Python", "Ruby", "Java"]

### 1. Return the following array: ["Python", "Ruby"].
### Ans: See index5.html

### 2. Combine the array with the array ["Haskell", "Clojure"].
### Ans: See index5.html

### 3. Return the string "JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java".
### Ans: See index5.html

### 4. Try to explain, in your own words (or diagrams!) what the difference is between passing by value vs. passing by reference.
### Ans: When a variable is assigned to another variable, if a change in anyone of the variables affects the other. Then, that is passign by reference. If not, it is passing by value

## Before you continue!
### Before you move on, check your understanding and make sure you can answer yes to the following questions:

### i. Do I know how to create an array?
### Ans: Yes

### ii. Do I know how to add an element to the beginning of an array?
### Ans: Yes

### iii. Do I know how to add an element to the end of an array?
### Ans: Yes

### iv. Do I know how to remove an element from the end of an array?
### Ans: Yes

### v. Do I know how to remove an element from the beginning of an array?
### Ans: Yes

### vi. Do I know how to remove an element from a specific index in an array?
### Ans: Yes

### vii. Do I know how to add one or more elements at a specific index in an array?
### Ans: Yes

### viii. Do I know what the includes function does?
### Ans: Yes

### ix. Do I know what the indexOf function does?
### Ans: Yes

### x. Do I know the difference between includes and indexOf?
### xi. Do I know why [] === [] always returns false?
